## Description

_This README organizes all of my independent solutions to Project Euler problems in one place._

## Statement of intent
_"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics." In doing these exercises, I am trying to refresh and refine my coding skills by solving each problem, often times in a variety of languages. This will allow me to remember syntax and think about ways to write cleaner code._

## Projects


| Problem Number  | Language       | Problem                  | Repository   |
